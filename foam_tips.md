## Structuring content

**Foam** is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.

Whether you want to build a [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) or a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/), or you want to [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) or just go with the flow, **Foam** can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:

1. Consider this **Foam** a workspace for all your knowledge and research.
2. Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them **Bubbles**, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. ([source](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles))
3. Use Foam's shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with Markdown links, and navigate between to explore your knowledge graph.


## Publishing

New Foams are not published by default. To publish your Foam,enable GitHub Pages on the default branch in repository settings.

If you don't like GitHub pages, you're free to set up any other deployment mechanism of your choosing.
